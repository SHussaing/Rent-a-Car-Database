## Project Summary

In the second year of my university studies, my colleague and I undertook a project focused on designing and creating a comprehensive relational database tailored for a car rental company, leveraging the robust capabilities of Oracle Database.

### Project Features

#### User Accounts
Our project encompassed the implementation of two distinct user accounts:
- A versatile general-purpose account, facilitating retrieval, insertion, deletion, and updating of data.
- A read-only account, specifically designed to empower company managers to access records from essential tables such as Customer, Car Rental, Extra Rental, and Rental Status.

#### Views
Our database solution incorporated pivotal views, including:
- A dynamic view revealing the most sought-after car models categorized by location.
- An informative read-only view delineating total rental amounts across various locations for the entirety of June 2022.

#### Triggers
We strategically integrated triggers to enhance database functionality, ensuring seamless data population and updates. Our project entailed the creation and deployment of multiple trigger types, each tailored to specific operational requirements.

#### Procedures
The implementation of procedural functionality was a cornerstone of our project. Through meticulously crafted procedures, we enabled efficient addition and modification of records within our database tables. Our endeavor involved the development of diverse procedure types, enriching the system's operational versatility.

#### Functions
Functional components played a pivotal role in our database's functionality. We meticulously designed and implemented various functions, empowering the system to perform intricate calculations and data manipulations with precision and efficiency.

#### Packages
Our project showcased the utilization of packages as a means to encapsulate and organize database subprograms. By leveraging packages, we bolstered the modularity and scalability of our database solution, facilitating seamless integration of diverse functionalities.

### Software Utilized

- **SQLDeveloper**: Employed for the creation and execution of SQL scripts, facilitating database management tasks with ease and efficiency.
